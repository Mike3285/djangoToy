# djangoToy
## A django project to play with. Will become a project template, maybe.
### Hello friends!

This is just a django almost-empty-project I'm playing a bit with. 

Feel *free* to clone this and tailor for your own needs.

You can find my custom Django classes and models in the djangoToy/custom.py file.


Other "cool" things are in the "utils.py" file. Those are just little functions to make some repetitive tasks easier.
Thank you for passing by!
