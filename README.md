## A django project to play with. Will become a project template, maybe.
Hello friends,
This is just a django almost-empty project I'm playing a bit with. You can find my custom Django classes and models in the djangoTOy/custom.py file.
Other "cool" things are in the "utils.py" file. Those are just little functions to make some repetitive tasks easier.
Thank you for passing by!
